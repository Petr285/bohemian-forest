      <h1>Bohemian Forest Fun Facts</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Plechý mountain (1,378 m) is the highest peak on the Czech side of
          the Bohemian Forest.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Plešné Lake is a glacial lake located directly beneath Plechý and
          is one of only a few of its kind in the Czech Republic.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Boubín Virgin Forest (Boubínský prales) is one of the oldest
          natural forests in Europe, protected since 1858.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Vltava River, which flows through Prague, has its source near
          Kvilda, a small mountain village in Šumava.
        </li>
        <li>
          During the Cold War, large parts of Šumava were a restricted border
          zone, which helped preserve its wild nature.
        </li>
        <li>
          The region is home to unique peat bogs, some over 8,000 years old, and
          many are now protected as nature reserves.
        </li>
        <li>
          Šumava and the Bavarian Forest together form a UNESCO Biosphere
          Reserve.
        </li>
        <li>
          Locals often say that Šumava has its own “microclimate” — misty
          mornings, sudden sunshine, and long winters.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Bohemian Forest plateau is so flat in places that rainwater can
          flow either north to the North Sea or south to the Black Sea.
        </li>
        <li>
          The area is often called the “Green Roof of Europe”, thanks to its
          high elevation and endless spruce forests.
        </li>
        <li>
          The oldest wooden church in the region, St. Stephen’s Chapel near
          Kvilda, dates back to the early 18th century.
        </li>
        <li>
          Brown bears used to roam Šumava until the late 19th century — now,
          they occasionally wander over from Slovakia or the Carpathians.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Sumava National Park is home to over 1,200 species of plants and
          300 species of vertebrates.
        </li>
        <li>
          The famous Poledník Lookout Tower was originally built as a Cold War
          military radar post.
        </li>
        <li>
          Traditional wooden houses in Šumava have a distinctive Alpine style,
          often with stone bases and painted shutters.
        </li>
        <li>
          In some villages like Kvilda and Horská Kvilda, temperatures can drop
          below –30 °C, making them the coldest places in the Czech Republic.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Laka Lake (Jezero Laka) is the smallest and shallowest glacial
          lake in the Bohemian Forest — it’s known for floating islands of peat.
        </li>
        <li>
          In local folklore, Šumava is sometimes called “the land of ghosts and
          fog”, inspired by its mysterious mists and legends of lost travelers.
        </li>
