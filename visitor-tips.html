      <ul>
        <li>
          The best time to visit is May–October for hiking and cycling, or
          December–March for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Modrava, Kvilda, and Srní are great starting points for exploring the
          central part of the park.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don’t miss the Boubín Lookout Tower, the Černé and Čertovo Lakes, or
          the Vydra River valley with its dramatic rock formations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many trails are accessible and well-marked — the Světly vrch – Březník
          – Modrava route offers one of the best views of the wild Šumava
          landscape.
        </li>
        <li>
          Visit the Information Centre in Kvilda or Srní to learn more about the
          local wildlife and conservation efforts.
        </li>
        <li>
          In winter, you can experience quiet snowy forests and perfectly
          groomed ski tracks with almost no crowds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Always be prepared for changing weather, especially in the higher
          parts — carry a rain jacket and warm clothes even in summer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Respect nature: stay on marked paths and avoid disturbing animals,
          especially during dusk and dawn.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some of the remote trails require a full day — bring snacks, water,
          and a map or GPS device.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many areas in Šumava have no mobile signal, so inform someone about
          your route before heading out.
        </li>
        <li>
          Biking is popular in summer; some trails are shared with hikers, so
          always stay alert.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wildlife spotting: early morning or late evening increases chances to
          see deer, lynx, or even wild boar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Photography tip: misty mornings create magical landscapes, especially
          around lakes and rivers.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are several small guesthouses and mountain huts along hiking
          trails — check opening times in advance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Camping is only allowed in designated areas — wild camping is
          prohibited to protect nature.
        </li>
        <li>
          Public transport is limited — renting a car or bike can make exploring
          easier.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cultural visits: explore historic villages with traditional wooden
          houses, or small museums about forestry and local traditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          For a unique experience, visit the Peat Bogs Educational Trail to see
          rare plants and learn about their ecological importance.
        </li>
